    "Welcome to your IDE! Your Jupyterlab IDE is a virtual development and execution environment for quantum programming. It is hosted in close physical proximity to the QPUs in Rigettiâ€™s quantum data center. This integrated platform eliminates the network latency found in web API access models, allowing you to iterate faster. It comes pre-configured with the Forest SDK which provides a convenient python library for writing quantum programs, and running them on the QVM and the QPU.\n",

It is located in the `hello_world.py` file located in the home folder of your server at `/forest-sdk-examples/hello_world.py`."
